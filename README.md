# Infona
Hackathon 2020 Project

This is our technical approach to the Infona app we designed. We are no programmers by any means and had no contact to app programming until a few days ago but we wanted to try anyway. We knew we were not going to finish a complete app but our goal was to get some experience, knowledge and most of all, have fun to try something new.
We also knew we were not going to learn a whole new programming language in this short time so we decided to use Android Studio to make it a little easier for ourselves but still have a challenge ahead of us.

In these files you can find some bits and pieces of the code we made work so far. It's very rough but it's something.
